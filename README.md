# Gold-Mine
A Simple Python Game 

Gold Mine is a simple python game I created as part of my application for an engineering apprenticeship. It is broken into two files:

- AEVT.py - contains functions, variables, and text (very large)

- AE.py - contains the structure of the game (relatively small)

It's not as complex as I originally imagined, but I had limited time to put this together. I intend to expand it, and maybe convert it into a more fleshed out experience using Ren'Py when I have time.
